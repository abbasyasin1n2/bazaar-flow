## How Can I Contribute?

- **Provide specific examples**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include screenshots if possible**

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any similar features in other applications**

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the code style of the project
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed

6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style

### Code Style

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
